# Unemployment-Rate-Forecast
Time series analysis of unemployment rates in the United States in the wake of COVID.

This project includes:
• Decomposition and seasonality analysis of the base data
• Fitting multiple standard ARIMA models to best mimic the behavior of the time series
• Conducting transformations and seasonal/mean differencing to induce stationarity
• Using the Meta Prophet algorithm to model COVID as a ‘holiday’
• Performing rolling window cross validation
